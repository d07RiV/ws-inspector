# Chrome WebSocket Viewer

[Chrome WebStore link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/websocket-frame-inspector/nlajeopfbepekemjhkjcbbnencojpaae)

Allows viewing binary WebSocket frame contents, which the default DevTools does not support.

Currently the data is shown in HTML based hex view, and does not work well for large frames (~10K+).
Considering switching to canvas based view instead.

If anyone knows an existing hex viewer module that does not use Angular, I'd be happy to use it instead.
